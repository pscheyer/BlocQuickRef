Git remote add processes, commit procs, add procs

cd [into folder, in this case BlocQuickRef in XcodeProj in Desktop]
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial Commit- added bloc foundation pdf files and blocquickref notes 1of6 file in progress'

[note, had to go through all of frickin' bloc again to find how to sync with a github account using their setup. Github's suggestions are useless too.]

git remote add origin https://github.com/pscheyer/BlocQuickRef.git
git push origin master

Takes a bit. the .pdfs are pretty big.

Saved this file and ran

git add .
git commit -m 'addl notes on process of initializing git and commits.'
