Notes from Bloc Foundation Recap
I'm rereading the entire bloc foundation course with the goal of converting it into a series of algorithms for accomplishing specific tasks in Objective-C. This should help with learning swift later- i can convert it much more easily into other languages in general, though it'll be of questionable usage if i do so as much of it is built into the Apple platform.

So. Starting off. Notes for every page.

-screenhero, 
-google hangouts/skype, and 
-xcode are all that's necessary. 
I think i should get maybe a smaller computer even less capable of other things. +1return Distraction. If so, a mac mini probably, in some place without internet. +1return
Code reviews and Pull Requests are critical. A code review is a systematic examination of computer source code, intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase.
Pull Requests are done through github. Pull requests ask others to review the set of changes suggested in the pull request, discuss potential modification, and push follow-up commits if necessary. +1return 

Review Pull Request process with Steve, formally set up projects in Github for multipeer project as fork from other 'example of functioning multipeer' project.

Bloc Overflow- went there and took a look. Seems pretty good. My approach is too wildly different for it though. Trying to answer other peoples' questions might be a good exercise. +1ret

assignment based on mentor expectations and apprentice expectations. 
Mentor expectationsYour mentor will lead your apprenticeship and may adjust the course to accommodate your learning curve Your mentor will be on time for meetings and meetings will last approximately 30 minutesYour mentor will respond promptly to issues that are blocking your progressYour mentor will review and complete submitted checkpoints and assignments in a timely fashionYour mentor will conduct regular code reviewsApprentice expectationsYou will trust the knowledge and experience of your mentor and accept the assignments and projects provided by your mentor You will be self-driven, motivated to learn, and able to commit at least 15/25/40 hours a week to working on the course based on your trackYou will attend meetings on time and be available for at least 30 minutes to work with your mentorYou will focus on how well you understand the information and not just whether or not your answer is "correct"You will keep your mentor informed when you get stuck, letting them know what the problem is and how you've sought to resolve it
